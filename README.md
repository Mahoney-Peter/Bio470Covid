## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and model the trend of COVID-19. 
More specifically, this project aims to explore how the distribution of COVID 
hospitalizations based on sex, race, and age categories change over 2019-2024.
This will be accomplished through visual and modeling approaches.

## Structure of code base
This project has only one code file, called Covid_Project_Mahoney. The code in 
this file has 3 dependencies: dplyr, ggplot2, and gridExtra.

## Structure of data
The data for this project comes from hospitalization data posted by COVID-NET 
through the CDC. The data has 9 columns (State, Season, Weekend date, age 
category, sex, race, rate type, weekly rate, and cumulative rate). Note that 
the data is not of individual hospitalizations, but rather it is already 
aggregated into hospitalizations per 100k based on the population 
characteristics in that row. For more info on this data, please see the
